# Introduction

In the first part of this chapter, we went through different action-value methods and action selection rules that we can apply to a stationary problem to ensure that our Reinforcement Learning agent is able to reach its goal effectively. However, most real-world problems are not stationary and as such, if we want to learn how Reinforcement Learning can actually be applied in a real-world scenario, we have to know how to deal with non-stationary problems.
