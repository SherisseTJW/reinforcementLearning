# Symmetries

Many tic-tac-toe positions appear different but are really the same because of symmetries. How might the learning process be amended to take advantage of this? In what ways would this change improve the learning process?

Now, think again.

Suppose the opponent did not take advantage of symmetries. In that case, should we? Is it true, then, that symmetrically equivalent positions should necessarily have the same value?
