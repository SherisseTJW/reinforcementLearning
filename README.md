# reinforcementLearning

This is a compilation of notes, as well as my answers to any exercises, programming or otherwise, as I go through the unofficial textbook for CS234 ( Reinforcement Learning Winter 2020 ) - [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, Sutton and Barto, 2nd Edition](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)

Obviously, this cannot be taken as a guide to Reinforcement Learning and there are bound to be errors as I am a mere beginner. If you are using this to learn RL, you have been warned.
